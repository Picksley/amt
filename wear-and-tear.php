      <p> If you keep your leased vehicle in good condition and within 'fair wear and tear' guidelines you won't incur any additional charges. However, if your car or van has damage which falls outside of these guidelines, you may be liable for an additional charge. This is to compensate the leasing company who will pay to rectify the damage or replace lost keys for example. But what constitutes 'fair wear and tear'? To ensure consistency across leasing and rental companies and to avoid misinterpretation, the BVRLA has produced a set of guidelines which acts as an industry-standard accepted level of fair wear and tear which AMT Leasing ad hear to.</p>
      <p> Fair Wear and Tear is simply defined as any acceptable deterioration that occurs on the vehicle during normal usage over the period of the contract. This will include affects to the tyres, bumpers, windows glass and any interior issues. You can read the full guide here: </p>

      <h3> We've summarised some of the key points below: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> The car should be returned in a safe and roadworthy condition, with all the appropriate documentation, spare keys and equipment. </li>
        <li> Cars should be services according to the manufacturers service schedule. Books should be stamped at the time of service to keep the history of the car. </li>
        <li> Before the car is returned, the car should be in a clean condition to allow a thorough inspection of the car. </li>
      </ol>
